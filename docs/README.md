**---  An open multi-method library for C++14 ---  
     + including some meta-programming facilities**  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

### Abstract
Vane implements open multi-methods in three ways  
dynamically dispatching mutiple arguments of
- intact ordinary polymorphic classes
- wrapper classes of polymorphic classes that have the same base
- wrapper classes of arbitrary (including non-polymorphic or primitive) types  

//The 3rd way is not exactly of open multi-methods but of 'multi-functions'  
, so being named 'vane::multi\_func'.  
None of them requires the existing class code to be modified.  
Vane is easy to use, requires no chaotic boilerplate devices to be put on the classes.  
vane::multi\_func itself is polymorphic  
; you can change the whole behavior of a 'mult\_func' at runtime  
by simply replacing it with another instance of a different multi\_func class  
just as you can do with ordinary polymorphic classes.  
Vane also includes meta-programming facilities that make meta-programming much easier.
