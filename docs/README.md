# Vee




**---  An Open multi-method library for C++14 ---  
     + including some meta-programming facilities**  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Abstract
Vee implements
open multi-methods in three ways  
dynamically dispatching mutiple arguments of  
- intact ordinal polymorphic classes
- wrapper classes of polymorphic classes that have the same base
- wrapper classes of arbitrary (including non-polymorphic or primitive) types  
  //The 3rd way is not exactly of open multi-methods.

None of them requires the existing class code to be modified.  
Vane also includes meta-programming facilities that make meta-programming much easier.
